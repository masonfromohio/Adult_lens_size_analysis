These R scripts are used to analyze the size of adult zebrafish lenses. I am using these in a project where we have used CRISPR gene editing to damage the genes for three alpha crystallins, and now we are assessing the effect of protein loss on the lens as it ages. This work will help us better undertand the roll of alpha crystallin proteins on preventing lens cataract as we age.
